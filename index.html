    <h1>Morning in the Burned House</h1>
    <h2>By Margaret Atwood</h2>

    <br>

    <p>In the burned house I am eating breakfast. <br> You understand: there is no house, there is no breakfast, <br> yet here I am.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The spoon which was melted scrapes against <br>
        the bowl which was melted also. <br> No one else is around.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Where have they gone to, brother and sister, <br> mother and father? Off along the shore, <br> perhaps. Their clothes are still on the hangers,</p>
    <br>
    <p>their dishes piled beside the sink, <br> which is beside the woodstove <br> with its grate and sooty kettle,</p>
    <br>
    <p>every detail clear, <br> tin cup and rippled mirror. <br> The day is bright and songless,</p>
    <br>
    <p>the lake is blue, the forest watchful. <br> In the east a bank of cloud <br> rises up silently like dark bread.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I can see the swirls in the oilcloth, <br> I can see the flaws in the glass, <br> those flares where the sun hits them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I can't see my own arms and legs <br> or know if this is a trap or blessing, <br> finding myself back here, where everything</p>
    <br>
    <p>in this house has long been over, <br> kettle and mirror, spoon and bowl, <br> including my own body,</p>
    <br>
    <p>including the body I had then, <br> including the body I have now <br> as I sit at this morning table, alone and happy,</p>
    <br>
    <p>bare child's feet on the scorched floorboards <br> (I can almost see) <br> in my burning clothes, the thin green shorts</p>
    <br>
    <p>and grubby yellow T-shirt <br> holding my cindery, non-existent, <br> radiant flesh. Incandescent.</p>
